node-rest-api
=============

An example of bringing to life the REST API architectural style.

All needed API documentation can be found under the root, after server starting (by using default setting it would be: http://localhost:3000/)

To start up just run the server and review API docs: node app.js 

To start server and import users from StackOverflow (ideally this command should be used just once, on setup phase):  node app.js --import
